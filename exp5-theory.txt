Apache Hive

    What It Is:
    Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. It allows users to query and manage large datasets stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) using a language similar to SQL, called HiveQL. Hive provides a high-level abstraction over MapReduce jobs, making it easier for data analysts and business users to interact with big data.

    Who Developed It:
    Originally developed by Facebook to simplify querying Hadoop data, Hive became open source and is now maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.

    Primary Usage:
    Hive is primarily used for data summarization, ad-hoc querying, and analysis of large datasets in batch-processing systems. It is not ideal for real-time querying but is very efficient for large-scale data analysis that does not require low-latency operations.

    Functionality:
    Hive converts HiveQL queries into MapReduce jobs, enabling SQL-like operations on massive datasets. Hive supports features like partitions, buckets, joins, views, and User Defined Functions (UDFs). It provides a simple interface for working with large data in Hadoop by abstracting the complexity of MapReduce programming.

    Additionally, Hive can integrate with other Hadoop ecosystem tools such as HBase and Pig, and it can also be extended using custom UDFs written in Java or other languages.

In this experiment, students will create tables in HDFS, load them into Apache Hive, and perform table joins using HiveQL. The goal is to demonstrate how Hive allows users to manage and query large datasets stored in HDFS using SQL-like commands and how it simplifies the process of joining data from multiple sources.
Key Steps:

    Create a Directory in HDFS to store the data files.

    Upload the CSV files into HDFS using the hadoop fs -put command.

    Create Hive Tables corresponding to the uploaded datasets, specifying the appropriate schema.

    Load Data into Hive Tables using the LOAD DATA command.

    Perform SQL Joins in Hive by writing queries to join tables and retrieve the required information.

Outcome:

Students will learn how to use Hive to manage and query large datasets stored in HDFS. This experiment shows how Hive simplifies the process of creating tables, loading data, and performing SQL joins, providing an abstraction over Hadoop's lower-level processing framework.
